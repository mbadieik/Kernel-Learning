# Kernel-Learning
The m.files includes the MATLAB simulations for the following papers:

1-Masoud Badiei Khuzani, Yinyu Ye, Sandy Napel, Lei Xing, "A Mean-Field Theory for Learning the Sch√∂nberg Measure of Radial Basis Functions", https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13330

2-Masoud Badiei Khuzani, Liyue Shen, Shahin Shahrampour, Lei Xing, "A Mean-Field Theory for Kernel Alignment with Random Features in Generative and Discriminative Models",  

To compare our method, we have also included the m.files that are developed by Sinha and Duchi in their papers:

3-Aman Sinha, John Duchi, "Learning Kernels with Random Features", https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6180-learning-kernels-with-random-features

Their codes are placed in the folder named "Sinha_util" to distinguish it from our MATLAB codes. The codes in "Sinha_util" folder are borrowed from Github page: https://github.com/duchi-lab/learning-kernels.
