# Kernel-Learning
The m.files contain the MATLAB simulations for the following papers:

1-Masoud Badiei Khuzani, Yinyu Ye, Sandy Napel, Lei Xing, "A Mean-Field Theory for Learning the Sch√∂nberg Measure of Radial Basis Functions", https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13330

2-Masoud Badiei Khuzani, Liyue Shen, Shahin Shahrampour, Lei Xing, "A Mean-Field Theory for Kernel Alignment with Random Features in Generative and Discriminative Models", https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11820.

To compare our proposed kernel learning methods with alternative approaches, we have also included the m.files that are developed by Sinha and Duchi in their papers:

3-Aman Sinha, John Duchi, "Learning Kernels with Random Features",  https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6180-learning-kernels-with-random-features

Their codes are placed in the folder named "Sinha_util" to distinguish it from our MATLAB codes. The codes in "Sinha_util" folder are borrowed from the Github page: https://github.com/duchi-lab/learning-kernels.

To run the codes, simply unzip the zipped files and add them to the MATLAB path. We have included two mat. files for two smaller data-sets in our papers from the UCI machine learning repository for the convenience of users. The other large-size data-sets could not be uploaded here. Nevertheless, they can be downloaded directly from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php.
